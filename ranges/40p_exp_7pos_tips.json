            "tips": "Post-flop, play aggressively from SB after RFI with a tight range (premium pairs, strong aces) against loose players. C-bet often on dry boards (e.g., K-7-2) for value, but check back on wet boards (e.g., J-T-9) to trap calling stations. With shallow stacks (20–50 BB), push for value; with deeper stacks (50–100 BB), be cautious of draws and overcalls."

On paired boards (e.g., K-K-7), value bet thin with middle pairs against their overcalls. On draw-heavy boards (e.g., Q-J-8), check-raise bluffs to punish their loose calls. With 20–50 BB stacks, shove draws or top pairs; with 50–100 BB, control pot size to avoid bloating."
